# game-dev-macroquad-rust-book
This repository is basically to save my progress studying the book "Game Development in Rust with Macroquad". So far a great book for an introduction to Macroquad.

<br>

Although the idea of ​​the book is for you to gradually progress your code from where you left off, note that I kept the codes separate in separate directories, because this way, in my opinion, I can have an even better idea of ​​progress and see the changes and evolutions.
